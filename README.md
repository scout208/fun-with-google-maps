Working with Google Maps API

#### How it works:
This is a Javascript application that allows you to search for attractions near any location. To search for a location, type it in the search box and hit enter. Then you can find different types of attractions in the area by selecting them in the bar on the right side and selecting submit. Pins will be placed on locations on the map. Clicking on them will give you the name of that attraction.
